    name: LCMCR
    fixed_alpha: false
    description: The original LCMCR port to Stan written by Shira Mitchell
  -
    name: LCMCR_2
    fixed_alpha: false
    description: >
      The same as LCMCR, except now we've fixed the label switching
      issue, increasing the split R-hat and effective sample size
      to reasonable values for each variable.
  -
    name: LCMCR_3
    fixed_alpha: false
    description: >
      The same as LCMCR2, except now the stick-breaking is done on
      a logarithmic scale, to address some numerical issues.
  -
    name: LCMCR_4
    fixed_alpha: false
    description: >
      The same as LCMCR3, except now the prior for alpha avoids the
      boundary at alpha=0, by using a lognormal distribution instead
      of gamma(epsilon, epsilon).
  -
    name: LCMCR_5_fixed_alpha
    fixed_alpha: true
    description: >
      The same as LCMCR3, except alpha is fixed in the data block.
